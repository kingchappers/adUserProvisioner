# AD User Provisioner

The idea of this program is to help automate the creation of users in Active Directory. 

This tool will use a configuration file allowing people to select from a list of approved options when it comes to things like department, office, etc. This should ensure that there is less chance of a user's configuration being a problem in the future. Standardising in this way should also help with other areas of automation; one that springs to mind is dynamic groups in Azure AD which allows you to automatically put people in certain AD groups depending on their user attributes. This can be difficult if there is no control over how attributes are input, or which ones are filled.

This project is new and not in a working state.
